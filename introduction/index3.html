        <p>The focus is on the mother to the child's education. German social welfare is very good, so most of the
            German
            mother in
            the first few years after the birth of a child with a child,Germans believe that the role of the mother of
            the
            child's
            growth has an important position, so the German full-time mother and even to their own as a mother proud. So
            when they
            make the effort to make the child, it also reveals the wisdom of everywhere:
            Self-reliance from the beginning of the meal</p>

        <p>When the baby can hold tableware from their meals, can sit to children to eat their own meals in the stool,
            mothers are
            fully prepared to clean up the mess. By the age of 3, you can have dinner at the dinner table with the
            adults.
            The most
            important thing is that they do not feed, do not force children to eat, my mother decided to prepare what
            nutrition
            food, do not eat, how to eat decided by the child. And China's adults are always worried about the child is
            too
            small to
            do sth over and over again, not enough to eat, people than our Chinese children grow stronger?</p>

        <p>In the concept of many families in Germany, there is no failure, only temporarily without success, so the
            German
            baby
            even a little age will know the truth. Have seen a Chinese follow their parents to the 5 year old German
            boy, a
            running
            race in a school, the children ran a sprained foot, the teacher used to comfort said "although failure, but
            you
            have
            been brave" and so on, the German children quickly corrected teacher: "I have not failed, but there is no
            success, hear
            others feel really great German doll.</p>
